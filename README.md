# Substitutes Notify

This is the notify submodule of the [substitutes](https://github.com/substitutes/) project.
Its goal is to notify users when the substitutes plan updates. This is accomplished via email.

## Deployment

Use docker or the binary distribution to deploy this application.

Be sure to edit/create the necessary configuration and user files *before* running `docker build -t substitutes/substitutes-notify`.
After that you can run it the usual way.

Deploying by binary is trivial.
